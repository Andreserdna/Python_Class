#Ch 6 Programming Assignment:
#Exercise 6.9, 6.11, 6.18, (6.16)

#6.9 (Conversions between feet and meters) Write a module that contains the following two functions:
#converts from feet to meters
	def footToMeter(foot):

#converts from meters to feet
	def meterToFeet(meter):

#the formulas for the conversion are
foot = meter / 0.305
meter = 0.305 * foot

#Write a test program that invokes these functions to display the following tables:
Feet 		Meters 		| 		Metes 		Feet
1.0			0.305		|		20.0		66.574
2.0			0.610		|		26.0		81.967
...
9.0			2.745		|		60.0		196.721
10.0		3.050		|		66.0		213.115


#6.11(Financial Application: compute commisions) Write a function that computes the commision using the scheme in exercise in 5.39. The header of the function is 

def computeCommision(salesAmount):

Write a program that displays the following table

Sales Amount  				Commision
1000							900.0
15000							1500.0
...
95000							11100.0
100000							11700.0


#6.13*(Display matrix of 0s and 1s) Write a function that displays an n-by-n matrix using the following header:

def printMatrix(n):

Each element is 0 or 1, which is generated randomly. Write a test program that
prompts the user to enter n and displays an n-by-n matrix. Here is a sample run:)

############
>>>
Enter n: 3 
0 1 0
0 0 0
1 1 1
>>>
